Objectives
In this practical, you will learn how to use PLINK for managing genotyping data.

Step 1: Understand the input data formats in PLINK
- First, create a working directory named `practical1`
```bash
mkdir practical1
cd practical1
```
- Let's have a look at the files

# xxx.bim stores the SNP information
less -S xxx.bim   #type "q" to quit

# xxx.fam stores the pedigree information for each sample
less -S xxx.fam
```
